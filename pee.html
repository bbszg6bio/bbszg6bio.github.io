    <p>The urinary system is a group of organs that work together to filter waste products from the blood and produce urine. It is made up of the following parts:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Kidneys</li>
      <li>Ureters</li>
      <li>Bladder</li>
      <li>Urethra</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located on either side of the spine. They filter waste products from the blood and produce urine. Urine is then transported from the kidneys to the bladder through the ureters.</p>
    
    <p>The bladder is a muscular organ that stores urine. When the bladder is full, it contracts and empties urine through the urethra.</p>
    
    <p>The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.</p>
    
    <h3>Functions of the Urinary System</h3>
    
    <p>The urinary system has a number of important functions, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Filtering waste products from the blood</li>
      <li>Producing urine</li>
      <li>Storing urine</li>
      <li>Eliminating urine from the body</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Common Urinary System Disorders</h3>
    
    <p>There are a number of disorders that can affect the urinary system, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Urinary tract infections (UTIs)</li>
      <li>Kidney stones</li>
      <li>Kidney failure</li>
      <li>Bladder cancer</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>UTIs are infections of the urinary tract. They can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.</p>
    
    <p>Kidney stones are hard deposits that can form in the kidneys. They can cause pain, bleeding, and infection.</p>
    
    <p>Kidney failure is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to function properly. It can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases.</p>
    
    <p>Bladder cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the bladder. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.</p>
