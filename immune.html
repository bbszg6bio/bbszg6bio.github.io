      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from infection. It is made up of two main components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="innate-immune-system">
      <h2>Innate Immune System</h2>
      <p>The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against infection. It is made up of a variety of cells and mechanisms that work to identify and destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Phagocytes:</b> These cells engulf and destroy foreign particles.</li>
        <li><b>Natural killer cells:</b> These cells kill cells that are infected with viruses or are otherwise damaged.</li>
        <li><b>Cytokines:</b> These proteins help to coordinate the immune response.</li>
        <li><b>Complement proteins:</b> These proteins help to destroy bacteria and viruses.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="adaptive-immune-system">
      <h2>Adaptive Immune System</h2>
      <p>The adaptive immune system is the body's second line of defense against infection. It is made up of a variety of cells and mechanisms that work together to identify and destroy specific pathogens.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>B cells:</b> These cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific antigens on pathogens.</li>
        <li><b>T cells:</b> These cells kill cells that are infected with viruses or are otherwise damaged.</li>
        <li><b>Memory cells:</b> These cells remember past infections and help the body to mount a faster and more effective response to future infections.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="disorders-of-the-immune-system">
      <h2>Disorders of the Immune System</h2>
      <p>The immune system can be weakened by a variety of factors, including stress, malnutrition, and certain medications. This can lead to a variety of disorders, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Autoimmune diseases:</b> These diseases occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.</li>
        <li><b>Immunodeficiencies:</b> These disorders occur when the immune system is unable to fight off infection.</li>
        <li><b>Allergies:</b> These reactions occur when the immune system overreacts to a harmless substance.</li>
      </ul>
