    <h2>The Lymphatic System</h2>

    <p>The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that helps to remove waste and toxins from the body. It also helps to fight infection and disease.</p>

    <p>The lymphatic system is made up of the following components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lymph nodes</li>
      <li>Lymph vessels</li>
      <li>Lymph</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that are located throughout the body. They filter lymph and remove waste products and toxins.</p>

    <p>Lymph vessels are thin tubes that carry lymph throughout the body. They connect lymph nodes to each other and to the bloodstream.</p>

    <p>Lymph is a clear fluid that contains white blood cells and other immune cells. It helps to fight infection and disease.</p>

    <h3>Functions of the Lymphatic System</h3>

    <p>The lymphatic system has a number of important functions, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Removing waste products and toxins from the body</li>
      <li>Fighting infection and disease</li>
      <li>Transporting nutrients and oxygen to cells</li>
      <li>Regulating fluid balance in the body</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Lymphatic System Disorders</h3>

    <p>There are a number of disorders that can affect the lymphatic system, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lymphedema</li>
      <li>Lymphoma</li>
      <li>Leukemia</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lymphedema is a condition that causes swelling in the arms, legs, or other parts of the body. It is caused by a blockage in the lymphatic system.</p>

    <p>Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. It can affect lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and other organs.</p>

    <p>Leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the blood-forming tissues of the body. It can also affect the lymphatic system.</p>
