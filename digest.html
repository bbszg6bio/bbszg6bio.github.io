    <p>The digestive system is a group of organs that work together to break down food and absorb nutrients. It is made up of the following parts:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Mouth</li>
      <li>Esophagus</li>
      <li>Stomach</li>
      <li>Small intestine</li>
      <li>Large intestine</li>
      <li>Rectum</li>
      <li>Anus</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The digestive process begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. Saliva contains enzymes that begin to break down carbohydrates. The food is then swallowed and travels down the esophagus to the stomach.</p>
    
    <p>The stomach is a muscular organ that churns and mixes food with gastric juices. Gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and enzymes that further break down food. The food is then passed into the small intestine.</p>
    
    <p>The small intestine is a long, coiled tube where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. The small intestine is lined with villi, which are small finger-like projections that increase the surface area for absorption. The pancreas and liver produce enzymes and bile that help to break down food and absorb nutrients.</p>
    
    <p>The large intestine is a shorter, wider tube that absorbs water and electrolytes from the food. The remaining waste products are formed into stool and stored in the rectum until they are eliminated through the anus.</p>
    
    <h3>Functions of the Digestive System</h3>
    
    <p>The digestive system has a number of important functions, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Breaking down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body</li>
      <li>Absorbing nutrients from food</li>
      <li>Eliminating waste products from the body</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Common Digestive System Disorders</h3>
    
    <p>There are a number of disorders that can affect the digestive system, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Heartburn</li>
      <li>Ulcers</li>
      <li>Crohn's disease</li>
      <li>Ulcerative colitis</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest that is caused by stomach acid flowing back into the esophagus.</p>
    
    <p>Ulcers are sores that can develop in the lining of the stomach or duodenum. They can be caused by a number of factors, including infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori.</p>
    
    <p>Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two types of inflammatory bowel disease. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.</p>
